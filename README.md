This project was realised by Theodora Mihailescu and Andrei Buzica.

The presented work is not ours, rather it is based on the work of Paul A. Gagniuc et al. Spectral forecast: A general purpose prediction model as an alternative to classical neural networks. Chaos 30, 033119 (2020); doi: 10.1063/1.5120818.

The corresponding article can be found [here](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.5120818).

This project gets input 3 matrices, A,B and P, and computes a 3D matrix of prediction, M. Then, it compares each layer of M with the matrix P and outputs a similarity index.

The similarity index is displayed in an output file: output.txt.
